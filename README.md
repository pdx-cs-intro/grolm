# GROLM: A GROcery List Manager
Bart Massey

An object-oriented grocery list manager, as presented to my
CS 161 classes at Portland State University.

This code is currently uncommented and has no real error
handling. The interface is terrible. This is just a demo,
and not suitable for real-life use.
